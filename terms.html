  <h1>Terms of Agreement</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 1, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Scope of Use</h2>
  <p>
    Lucira Systems is a public interface for decentralized governance engines designed for ethical operation, legal clarity, and structured innovation. By interacting with this platform, you agree to operate within the bounds of lawful, non-malicious use.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Ownership and Intellectual Protection</h2>
  <p>
    The internal systems, UI/UX design, engine architecture, and identity framework of Lucira are protected under strict licensing. You may not reproduce, copy, fork, reverse-engineer, or redistribute any part of the platform or its underlying logic.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lucira is not open-source. You are granted access to utilize its public engines commercially — but the engines themselves remain the sole property of Lucira Systems. Any derivative work must receive prior written authorization.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Commercial Engine Use</h2>
  <p>
    Approved engines such as RIE, MIE, DAFE, EIIE, and TAXE may be used for commercial purposes, provided they do not attempt to bypass the ULI, access non-public functions, or extract internal data. Commercial use must remain within ethical, regulated, and transparent bounds.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Privacy and Protection Protocols</h2>
  <p>
    All user data, queries, and interactions are filtered through the Universal Logic Interface (ULI) and logged via internal systems to ensure safety, integrity, and compliance with platform standards. Caeliaris, the protected core of Lucira, is not accessible to the public under any circumstance.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Disclaimer and Limitation</h2>
  <p>
    Lucira Systems provides its services “as-is” without warranty or guarantee of uptime, future access, or integration. The team reserves the right to revoke access or modify functions at any time if misuse or ethical misalignment is detected.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Legal Jurisdiction</h2>
  <p>
    All disputes or legal questions shall be governed under the internal legal frameworks defined by the Legal Interoperability Engine (LIE), where applicable. Users agree to submit to these frameworks as a condition of continued use.
  </p>
